# Row-major or Col-major will be contractidary features.

# Use aligned allocation in some cases (64-byte alignment for vector larger than 128 elements).
# If this feature not specified, for CPU it will use default allocator of `Vec<T>`.
# This feature is not intended for pinned-memory allocation (to memory pages), only for (possible) SIMD and cache line.

# Dispatch dimensinoality in layout iterators
# This option is recommended for efficiency for large tensor, especially with non-contiguous strides.
# However, this feature will add runtime overhead for small tensor.
# And more importantly, this feature will hugely increase compile time.
