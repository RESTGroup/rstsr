# rstsr-sci-traits

This crate featuring implementations similar to SciPy. Something like a forge of numerical methods.

This crate is still experimental. The developer has nither implemented much methods, nor decided how to implement. Anyway, functionality of some SciPy functions is essential for RSTSR, so this crate now exists.
